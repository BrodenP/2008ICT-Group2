          <h3>Sea Level Rise and Brisbane‚Äôs Coastal Vulnerability</h3>
          <p>Brisbane‚Äôs proximity to both the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay places it at increasing risk from rising sea levels‚Äîone of the most immediate threats posed by climate 
            change. Since 1880, global sea levels have risen by approximately 20 centimetres, and scientific models forecast continued acceleration due to melting glaciers 
            and polar ice sheets. For a city with many low-lying coastal and riverside suburbs, this represents a serious challenge. Areas like Wynnum, Sandgate, and parts of 
            the inner city are especially vulnerable during extreme weather events such as storm surges or king tides. Flooding in these locations can damage roads, homes, 
            public transport lines, and drainage systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            As tides and rainfall patterns shift, there is an increased likelihood of saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies 
            and erosion of protective shorelines. To respond, Brisbane City Council has begun implementing adaptive measures, including stricter flood zone planning, upgraded 
            drainage infrastructure, and community flood awareness campaigns. Long-term strategies may also include the development of elevated walkways, seawalls, and the 
            restoration of coastal wetlands as natural buffers. However, these interventions require ongoing investment and coordination between all levels of government and 
            the community.

          <h3>Increasing Bushfire Risk in South East Queensland</h3>
          <p>Climate change is intensifying bushfire conditions across Queensland, and the greater Brisbane region is no exception. Rising temperatures, reduced rainfall, and 
            more frequent droughts are creating drier landscapes that act as kindling for wildfires. The fire season is lengthening, and days of extreme fire danger are occurring 
            more regularly in areas that previously saw minimal threat. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In Brisbane, suburbs near bushland‚Äîsuch as The Gap, Mount Coot-tha, and Samford Valley‚Äîare increasingly 
            under threat. Urban sprawl into forested areas has further complicated emergency response, placing more homes and infrastructure in the path of potential fires. 
            Additionally, the presence of thick vegetation around residential areas means even minor ignition sources can lead to fast-spreading bushfires under the right weather 
            conditions. Beyond physical damage, bushfires also create hazardous air quality across the metropolitan area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smoke from distant fires can blanket the city, leading 
            to school closures, reduced visibility, and public health warnings. Brisbane‚Äôs emergency services are now investing in more advanced fire detection, public alert 
            systems, and community preparedness programs to reduce the risk and severity of future bushfire events.

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>What is causing climate change in Australia?</strong>
              <p>Human activities‚Äîparticularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas‚Äîare the primary drivers of climate change in Australia. These activities 
              release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to long-term warming trends across the country.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How has Brisbane‚Äôs climate changed in recent decades?</strong>
              <p>Brisbane has experienced rising average temperatures, more frequent heatwaves, and shifts in rainfall patterns. Since 1910, Queensland's average temperatures 
              have increased by around 1.5¬∞C, contributing to longer fire seasons, increased evaporation, and more extreme weather events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Is sea level rise a real threat to Brisbane?</strong>
              <p>Yes. Brisbane‚Äôs coastal suburbs, including Wynnum, Sandgate, and parts of the CBD, face increased risks from rising sea levels and storm surges. This poses 
              challenges for infrastructure, housing, and flood management systems‚Äîespecially during king tides or severe storms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How does climate change affect bushfire risk in Queensland?</strong>
              <p>Climate change is intensifying bushfire conditions across Queensland, including the Brisbane region. Hotter temperatures, drier vegetation, and prolonged 
              droughts create ideal conditions for fires, increasing both their frequency and severity. Suburbs near bushland, such as The Gap and Mount Coot-tha, are particularly vulnerable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What is Brisbane doing to address climate change?</strong>
              <p>Brisbane City Council has implemented sustainability strategies such as reducing emissions in council operations, expanding green public transport, and 
              supporting solar energy uptake. There are also community programs encouraging tree planting, water conservation, and energy efficiency to help residents adapt 
              and reduce their impact.</p>
